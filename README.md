Academic Projects

Here are some academic projects during my time at the University of Toronto. 

# Apple Stock Forecast (https://stephenhuang.pb.online/project1): 
As a team of five, we applied various statsicalical and machine learning models to prediction Apple's stock price.  I was resonsible for training and applying the Decision Tree and Random Forest regressor. The algorithms ran on the Hadoop cluster offered by Queens University. 
The goal is the predict Apple's stock price for different horizons.

# Boston House Price (https://stephenhuang.pb.online/project2):
This individual project involves predicting Boston suburb house prices using data from the Boston Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) in 1970. Instead of importing existing machine learning methods, I was required to develope my own Linear Regression algorithm. 

# Maze Navigation Robot (https://stephenhuang.pb.online/project3):
As a team of five, we designed and built an autonomous robot that can find and delivering a block while maneuvering through a maze. The robot is designed and built by us from scratch, using various components and laser-cut acrylic boards.
The map of the maze is preloaded into the program, but the robot's starting area is random. The goal is for the robot to navigate through the maze, find and pickup a block, then deliver that block to one of 4 unloading zones.
The robot utilize various sensor inputs to calculate its current position. It communicates that information to a computer that runs the MATLAB navigation algorithm (via Bluetooth). I developed the MATLAB algorithm, which calculates the best next action for the robot.
